1. Introduction

This report analyzes a Python implementation of a blockchain system. The system includes a custom SHA-256 hashing algorithm, block mining functionality, and transaction management. The key components of the code are broken down to explain their purpose and design.
2. Custom SHA-256 Implementation

The SHA-256 implementation is a core part of the system, manually defined rather than relying on external libraries. Key aspects include:
Message Preprocessing: The input message is padded to meet the requirements of the SHA-256 algorithm, ensuring its length is a multiple of 512 bits, with the final 64 bits representing the message length.
Compression Function: The algorithm processes 512-bit chunks of data using initial hash values and 64 constants defined in the SHA-256 specification.
Final Output: The hash values are concatenated to produce a 256-bit digest.
Strengths:
Adheres to the theoretical workings of SHA-256.
Demonstrates a deep understanding of hashing.
Limitations:
Computationally inefficient compared to optimized libraries.
Vulnerable to implementation bugs.
3. Blockchain Structure

The blockchain consists of three main classes: Transaction, Block, and Blockchain.
3.1. Transaction Class
Defines the structure of transactions with attributes for sender, receiver, and amount.
Example:

Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)

3.2. Block Class
Represents a block in the blockchain with the following attributes:
Index: Block number.
Timestamp: Creation time.
Transactions: List of transactions included in the block.
Merkle Root: Hash summarizing all transactions.
Nonce: Incremented during mining to find a valid hash.
Hash: Unique identifier for the block.
The block includes methods to:
Calculate the hash of its contents.
Compute the Merkle root of transactions.
Perform proof-of-work mining.
3.3. Blockchain Class
Manages the chain of blocks and ensures the integrity of the blockchain. Functions include:
Genesis Block Creation: Initializes the chain with a genesis block.
Block Addition: Mines a new block and appends it to the chain.
Blockchain Validation: Verifies that all blocks maintain integrity.
4. Features and Demonstration

4.1. Mining and Proof-of-Work
The proof-of-work mechanism ensures blocks have a hash starting with a specified number of zeros (difficulty). Mining adjusts the nonce to meet this requirement.
4.2. Validation
The validate_blockchain method checks:
The hash integrity of each block.
Consistency between previous_hash and the hash of the preceding block.
4.3. Demonstration
The demo includes a blockchain with one block containing multiple transactions. Validation confirms the blockchain's integrity, and key block details are printed for verification.
5. Observations

Efficiency: Custom SHA-256 adds computational overhead.
Security: Relies on implementation correctness.
Usability: Suitable for educational purposes and small-scale projects.
6. Recommendations

For production-grade applications, use standard libraries for cryptographic functions to ensure efficiency and security.
Extend the system with additional features like:
Decentralization through network simulation.
Enhanced transaction validation.
Smart contract support.
7. Conclusion

This implementation provides a foundational understanding of blockchain mechanics, including hashing, proof-of-work, and blockchain validation. While limited in scalability and efficiency, it serves as an excellent educational tool for exploring blockchain concepts.
